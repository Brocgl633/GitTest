## Q1. Short Answers

### ✔ 1. Relationship between UML Activity Diagram and UML System Sequence Diagram

UML Activity Diagrams and UML System Sequence Diagrams (SSD) are both used to model different aspects of a system. An Activity Diagram captures the dynamic aspects of a system by showing the flow of control or data from one activity to another. It is particularly useful for detailing complex processes and workflows within the system. On the other hand, a System Sequence Diagram focuses on the interaction between actors and the system, detailing the sequence of messages exchanged during a particular scenario of a use case. While an Activity Diagram emphasizes the internal flow and actions, an SSD emphasizes the order of interactions between the external and the system and message exchanges in time, making both complementary in understanding system behavior.

### ✔ 2. Reusable, Flexible, and Extensible Object-Oriented Design

Reusability means designing components that can be used across different systems or contexts without modification.
Flexibility involves creating systems that can adapt to changing requirements or environments with minimal impact.
Extensibility is about designing systems in a way that new functionalities can be added with minimal changes to existing code.
Achieving these goals involves principles such as encapsulation, polymorphism, modularity, and the use of design patterns that promote loose coupling and high cohesion.

### ✔ 3. UML Notations for Structure and Behavior

UML provides various notations to capture the structure and behavior of software systems:

- **Structural Diagrams:**
  - **Profile diagram:** It is a special type of UML class diagram that extends the UML metamodel to support the modeling requirements of a particular domain or application.
  - **Class Diagram:** Shows the static structure of a system, including classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.
  - **Composite Structure diagram:** It describes and emphasizes the internal structure and composition of a system or object.
  - **Component Diagram:** Represents the physical components in a system and their interconnections.
  - **Deployment Diagram:** Illustrates the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes.
  - **Object diagram:** It is used to show object instances and their relationships in a system or software.
  - **Package diagram:** It shows the different modules in the system and the relationships between them. These modules can be classes, interfaces, subsystems, or other packages.

- **Behavioral Diagrams:**
  - **Activity Diagram:** Depicts the workflow of activities and actions.
  - **Interaction Diagram:** It includes Sequence Diagram, Communication Diagram, Interaction Overview Diagram, Timing Diagram. It is a graphical representation of the interaction between objects.
  - **Sequence Diagram:** Shows how objects interact in a particular sequence of events.
  - **Use Case Diagram:** Captures the functional requirements and interactions between actors and the system.
  - **State Machine Diagram:** Describes the states of an object and the transitions between those states.

### ✔ 4. UML Use-Case Diagram and Non-Functional Requirements

No. Non-functional requirements specify non-behavioral properties of the system and the constraints on those properties. And Functional requirements specify the behavior of the system and the constraints on that behavior. So these behavioral requirements cannot capture non-functional requirements.

### ✔ 3. UML Use-Case Diagram

Here is a description of the use-case diagram elements, as creating the visual diagram directly is not feasible in this text format:

- **Actors:** Customer, Manager, Account Specialist, Sales Team
- **Use Cases:**
  - Add/Delete Route
  - Cancel/Update/Delete Order Type
  - Add/Delete Commuting Plans
  - Create/Update Account
  - Create Incident Ticket
  - Check Account Exist
  - Forecast Sales/Demand
  - Analyze Demand
  - Send Notification
  - Enroll in Plan
  - Order/Purchase Service
  - Update Record
  - Pay Monthly Bill
  - Change/Cancel/Add Plan
  - Review/Rate Plan
  - Review/Rate Ride
  - Subscribe/Unsubscribe Notifications
  - Check Notification Condition

### ✔ 4. UML Analysis Class Diagram

The analysis class diagram would include classes like Customer, Manager, Account Specialist, Sales Team, Plan, Subscription, Route, and various types of plans (BusPlan, TrainPlan, BikePlan, ConveniencePlan, DailyPlan). Relationships would detail interactions such as a Customer having Subscriptions, a Manager managing Routes, and an Account Specialist managing Customer accounts.
