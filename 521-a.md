## Q1. Short Answers

### 1. Relationship between UML Activity Diagram and UML System Sequence Diagram

UML Activity Diagrams and UML System Sequence Diagrams (SSD) are both used to model different aspects of a system. An Activity Diagram captures the dynamic aspects of a system by showing the flow of control or data from one activity to another. It is particularly useful for detailing complex processes and workflows within the system. On the other hand, a System Sequence Diagram focuses on the interaction between actors and the system, detailing the sequence of messages exchanged during a particular scenario of a use case. While an Activity Diagram emphasizes the internal flow and actions, an SSD emphasizes the external interactions and message exchanges, making both complementary in understanding system behavior.

### 2. Reusable, Flexible, and Extensible Object-Oriented Design

An intelligent object-oriented design aims to be reusable, flexible, and extensible. Reusability means designing components that can be used across different systems or contexts without modification. Flexibility involves creating systems that can adapt to changing requirements or environments with minimal impact. Extensibility is about designing systems in a way that new functionalities can be added with minimal changes to existing code. Achieving these goals involves principles such as encapsulation, modularity, and the use of design patterns that promote loose coupling and high cohesion.

### 3. UML Notations for Structure and Behavior

UML provides various notations to capture the structure and behavior of software systems:

- **Structural Diagrams:**
  - **Class Diagram:** Shows the static structure of a system, including classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.
  - **Component Diagram:** Represents the physical components in a system and their interconnections.
  - **Deployment Diagram:** Illustrates the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes.

- **Behavioral Diagrams:**
  - **Use Case Diagram:** Captures the functional requirements and interactions between actors and the system.
  - **Sequence Diagram:** Shows how objects interact in a particular sequence of events.
  - **Activity Diagram:** Depicts the workflow of activities and actions.
  - **State Machine Diagram:** Describes the states of an object and the transitions between those states.

### 4. UML Use-Case Diagram and Non-Functional Requirements

UML Use-Case Diagrams primarily document the functional requirements of a system by capturing the interactions between users (actors) and the system to achieve specific goals. While they are focused on behavioral aspects, non-functional requirements (such as performance, security, usability) are not explicitly represented. However, these non-functional aspects can be implicitly referenced in use-case descriptions or associated documentation, ensuring they are considered during the design process. Additional models or specifications are typically used to detail non-functional requirements explicitly.

### 3. UML Use-Case Diagram

Here is a description of the use-case diagram elements, as creating the visual diagram directly is not feasible in this text format:

- **Actors:** Customer, Manager, Account Specialist, Sales Team
- **Use Cases:**
  - Enroll in Plan
  - Order/Purchase Service
  - Add/Delete Route
  - Manage Plan
  - Create/Update Account
  - Create Incident Ticket
  - Forecast Sales/Demand
  - Analyze Demand
  - Update Record
  - Pay Monthly Bill
  - Change/Cancel/Add Plan
  - Review/Rate Plan
  - Subscribe/Unsubscribe Notifications

### 4. UML Analysis Class Diagram

The analysis class diagram would include classes like Customer, Manager, Account Specialist, Sales Team, Plan, Subscription, Route, and various types of plans (BusPlan, TrainPlan, BikePlan, ConveniencePlan, DailyPlan). Relationships would detail interactions such as a Customer having Subscriptions, a Manager managing Routes, and an Account Specialist managing Customer accounts.
