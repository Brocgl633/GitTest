Peer nodes download files from each other concurrently:
According to the following console output, t1.txt is registered on peer_1 and stored on peer_1 and peer_2. The download request can be sent through peer_2, and ten copies of t1.txt are successfully downloaded concurrently based on the specified starting offset and chunk size:












Below is the download speed table for downloading ten 1162kb files with different numbers of peers:
Peer nodes	2	4	8	16
Download speed (byte/ms)	291.2	208.00	172.65	155.12

Conclusion:
The file download speed is opposite to the number of connected peer nodes. The reason may be that as the number of peer nodes increases, the number of times that the file needs to be traversed during downloading increases. So, the program running time increases, and resulting in a decrease in the speed.
