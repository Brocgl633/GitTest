Shown below are the average response times for various numbers of clients downloading 300 files:
1. The horizontal axis indicates the number of clients.
2. The vertical axis indicates whether the file is stored on the directly connected super peer.

True     23.11ms	  45.24ms	   37.35ms	  62.68ms
False               69.20ms  	106.23ms	 121.11ms



all-to-all topology:
           1          2          4          8
True     31.06ms	  34.97ms  	 47.12ms	  58.33ms
False               52.04ms	   56.10ms	  74.30ms



According to the test data, if files are stored on the super peer directly connected to the weak peer, the average response time is shorter than that on the super peer indirectly connected to the weak peer. In addition, the average response time is positively correlated with the number of message forwarding times. That is, the larger the number of message forwarding times, the shorter the average response time.
